# 2023 State Farm Coding Competition - Round 1 and 2

This is the GitHub project for the 2023 State Farm Coding Competition Round 1 and 2. This will be the same project you'll use once Round 1 begins.


**Please be sure to read this entire document *PRIOR* to moving into one of the language-specific folders.**

## Change Log:

- October 14, 2023 - Publishing problem sets
    - [Problem Statement PDF](./round%201/ROUND_ONE_PROMPT.pdf)
- October 6, 2023 - Publishing initial repo, including help guides and skeleton projects
    - This is to just get you started -- making sure your computer is setup, that you are able to build and run the project (including unit tests), and getting familiar with the structure.
    - The Problem Statement and relevant JSON files will be published at the start of Round 1

## Getting Started

### Selecting a Project Folder

Based on the language you are the most comfortable using, pick one of the following folders to begin:

- [`java` (Java)](./java/)
- [`nodejs` (JavaScript)](./nodejs/)
- [`python` (Python 3)](./python/)

Inside each folder is the specific instructions for that language for:

- What software you need to build and run the project
- Commands for running unit tests
- Considerations for that language

### Use Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

We recommend using VSCode, our editor of choice. Several reasons are:

- Support for extensions that we'll recommend for each project to reduce time spent on environment setup and syntax issues
- Great support and performance across multiple platforms
- What we used to setup and test these projects

More on using other editors below.

### Git

You will need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your machine. It is supported on many platforms. For more on Git and VSCode, see [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview). For other editors, you will need to search around the Internet.

## Considerations

### Using Editors Other Than VSCode

We primarily use and heavily recommend VSCode for this competition, especially if you run into any problems relating to software and your workstation. We cannot help with every issue that may arise, but by using VSCode, we can hopefully get to a quicker solution for certain edge cases (environment not setup correctly for example).

We also cannot guarantee that these projects will work with other editors. Your mileage may vary.
### Plan to Carry This Project into Round 2

Plan accordingly to use this project for round 2 of the competition. You'll want to make sure your code is reusable and easy to understand, tweak, and maintain. Otherwise, you may have a difficult time with the round 2 problem set.

## Feedback

At the ends of Round 1 and 2, we need you to fill out [FEEDBACK.md](./FEEDBACK.md). It includes a few questions such as team name, number of unit tests passed, any notable characteristics. Please
