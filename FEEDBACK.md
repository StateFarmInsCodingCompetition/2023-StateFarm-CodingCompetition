# Feedback

1. Your team: CodeBoys
2. Name of each individual participating:Joshua Peck, Zachary Lake
3. How many unit tests were you able to pass? 
    We did not complete test 11, 10 or 8.
    8 was due to not being able to submit a null value for a method that returns a primitive value (int), when changed to Integer the test threw errors
    10 passed all except for one and it was off by around .25 so I believe it may be a rounding error, but similarly to 8 when changed to Decimal the test threw errors
4. Document and describe any enhancements included to help the judges properly grade your submission.
    NA

5. Any feedback for the coding competition? Things you would like to see in future events?
