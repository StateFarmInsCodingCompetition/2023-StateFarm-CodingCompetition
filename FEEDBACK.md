1. Your team:
    It's a team of one, so if this is meant to be a name, Elaine's team
2. Name of each individual participating:
    Kristen "Elaine" Waddle
3. How many unit tests were you able to pass?
    12! (the one I didn't pass was Test 12, the one that was made optional through email)
4. Document and describe any enhancements included to help the judges properly grade your submission.
    - I created a helper method to build the dictionaries for getting the states with the most and
      least disasters
    - I added comments in my methods that were a little harder to parse

5. Any feedback for the coding competition? Things you would like to see in future events?
    I had a great time! This was really approachable as my first GitHub project/the first time I used JSON, and I feel like I learned a decent amount. No feedback besides that I wish it was happening in the Spring, too.
