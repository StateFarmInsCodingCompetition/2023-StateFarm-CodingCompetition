    - I included the method for calculating the estimated total cost of a specific disaster by its claims.
    - I included the method for calculating the average estimated cost of all claims assigned to a claim handler.
    - I included the method to find the name of the state with the most disasters based on disaster data.
    - I included the method to find the name of the state with the least disasters based on disaster data.
    - I included the method to find the name of the most spoken language by agents (besides English) for a specific state.
    - I included the method to find the number of open claims for a specific agent and for a minimum severity level and higher, but it didn't pass the test.

    - I couldn't figure out the rest in time, but I will still figure them out in my free time. I think I will be able to do them in an hour or two.

5. Any feedback for the coding competition? Things you would like to see in future events?
    - It was fun! Although I couldn't figure out all the tests, I had a great time, trying to figure things out. I would like to see something similiar to this in future events. I am looking forward to them!
