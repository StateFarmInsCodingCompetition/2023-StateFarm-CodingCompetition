# Feedback

1. Your team: Walden Tech
2. Name of each individual participating: Matthew Walden
3. How many unit tests were you able to pass? 
All but the last, however, the email said "Again, our tests were wrong and you've got the right answer." So, I'm going to claim that I got all of them, I just have not changed the test file as specified in the rules. Thanks!
4. Document and describe any enhancements included to help the judges properly grade your submission.
    - Example One 
Included rest API, install express [npm i should do the trick, as it is in package.json], then start application.js, then navigate to http://localhost:1234 [unless you specify a different env port]. Then, the paths are documented on base path [/]
    - Example Two
    - Example Three

5. Any feedback for the coding competition? Things you would like to see in future events?
I honestly have really enjoyed this. The problems that were found were quick to be rectified or explained. Would love to participate in the future. I would say it would be nice for the documentation on projects to be a little bit more specific, but it was still quick, fun, and easy. Great job!
