    - I implemented a method to see which types of disasters were most common, which I added to my simple data tool.  
    - I implemented a method to plot severity rating vs costs of claims. I was surpsied to see that even some severity 10 claims had low costs.  

5. Any feedback for the coding competition? Things you would like to see in future events?
