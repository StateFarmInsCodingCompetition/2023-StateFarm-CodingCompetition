5. Any feedback for the coding competition? Things you would like to see in future events?
Participating in this competition has been a wonderful learning experience for us. 

Having mentors to offer guidance and feedback on our implementations before we make the final submission would be really helpful for next. Additionally, it would be fantastic to gain exposure to cloud technologies, which are becoming increasingly important in software development.
