    - Add UI to view JSON files in table format. Set up instructions:
    
        - Navigate to `nodejs`: `cd ./nodejs`
        - Install packages: `npm install`
        - Start localhost: `npm start`
        - The website will then be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
     
    - Add Chart View to visualize the number of claims per month. The same setup instructions as above.
        - Some code when implementing this feature is duplicated from `simpleDataTool.js`, since I didn't have time to implement REST API. This is something that could be improved in the future.
    
5. Any feedback for the coding competition? Things you would like to see in future events?

    - I had fun working on those problems! Thank you to the team who organized this! Just a small feedback, it would be nicer if the competition occurred a little bit earlier!
