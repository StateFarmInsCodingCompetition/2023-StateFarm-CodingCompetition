## Solutions
- We wanted an easy way for the users to be able to visualize and wrangle the data. We implemented a simple CRM system that allows the users to view the data, and do any CRUD operations
- We also implement a simple visualization that shows the user the disasters in the area and it can be filtered over time

## Demo
- Demonstrate the CRM system and filtering, not able to update and delete yet
- Demonstrate the plot

## Conclusion
- Implement a Update and Delete method to make the dataframes editable. Currently it can be filtered and exported in the desired format
- Had trouble when trying to plot other US-states data, figure out a solution for that
